# LoginPrompt
<b> Prompt User Login </b>

Our idea is to create a Login System using little Python console where we ask the person for a username and password. We will create a page that says like would you like to create an account or log in. Based on what they choose, they will have the options to either. If they decide to log in and they attempt to enter the wrong password, then the system will take a picture of their face. If they don't have an account, then they can create an account. To create an account, they will need an email address, username, password, confirming the password, and security questions. We will have six different security questions for the user to select from. There will be two security questions to complete. Questions will be like: What city were you born? What is your petâ€™s name? What is your favorite color? And etc. All information will be stored in some kind of text file. It is going to save the information and validate every time they log in against the text file. 

<h1> Project Structure </h1>

First of all install Python3 and pip on your system from their respective sites, We make use of something called virtualenv to make our project locally sustainable and encapsulate it. virtualenv will be our base and we will create the steps below with in our Systematic Process guide the users through this project.
